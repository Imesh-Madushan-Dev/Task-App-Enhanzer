Objective: To create a mobile application using Flutter that allows users to manage a list of tasks. 
Users should be able to add, view, update, and delete tasks. 

The application should follow the 
MVVM architecture pattern and utilize a local SQLite database for data storage.
Requirements:

User Interface:
• Design a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
• Provide a form to add new tasks.
• Allow users to edit and delete existing tasks.
• Display the list of tasks using a ListView or GridView.

Architecture:
• Follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.
• Ensure separation of concerns by keeping UI code in the View, business logic in the ViewModel, and data access in the Repository.
• Implement a repository layer between the ViewModel and the database helper.
• Implement state management using a suitable package (e.g., Provider, Riverpod).

Data Storage:
• Use SQLite for local data storage.
• Implement a repository pattern for data access using a package like sqflite.

Technologies:
• Flutter, Dart, sqflite package for SQLite, provider or any other state management
